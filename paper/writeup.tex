\begin{abstract}
    Foreshadowing haplotype-based methods of the genomics era,
    it is an old observation that the ``junction'' between two distinct haplotypes
    produced by recombination is inherited as a Mendelian marker.
    In this paper, we describe how this recombination-mediated information
    can in many cases be recovered from inference based solely on
    polymorphic markers (i.e., information produced by mutation),
    which produces unary nodes along the branches of the marginal genealogical trees.
    The resulting inferred ARGs, represented as tree sequences,
    are smaller, faster to compute with,
    and potentially contain substantially more information
    about the age of ancestral haplotypes,
    than inferred ARGs without these unary nodes.
    We provide efficient algorithms to identify this ancestral haplotype information,
    new metrics of agreement/disagreement between inferred ARGs,
    and explore some consequences for ARGs inferred from real data.

\section{Introduction}

% PETER
% * what's a tree sequence
% * why is a tree sequence (motivation)

There has been substantial recent progress
in the problem of ``ARG inference'',
which seeks to infer (portions of) the ``ancestral recombination graph'' (or, ARG)
that describes how a set of genotypes samples are related to each other
at each position of the genome.
For reviews of this progress, see CITE CITE CITE.
Often such methods focus on the sequence of ``marginal trees'',
i.e., the genealogical trees that describe how each portion of the genome
was inherited by the focal genomes.
For instance, the ``succinct tree sequence'',
introduced by \citet{kelleher2016efficient},
is a common format for describing these inferred ARGs,
and is seeing wide use thanks in part to its efficiency and accompanying reliable toolkit,
\tskit (CITE).

However, the ARG is emphatically not merely a sequence of trees:
since each segment of an ancestor's genome that has been inherited by the focal genomes
may extend over a portion of the genome over which there are many distinct trees,
a single ancestor should usually be represented by nodes in many distinct trees.
In other words, one way to view an ARG is as a sequence of trees in which nodes may be shared across many trees,
but another way to view the ARG is as a set of relationships between segments of ancestral haplotypes.

Another reason we tend to focus on the trees is that
much of our intuition about inference of relationships from genomic data
comes from phylogenetics.
Indeed, all methods might very roughly be summarized as
``more similar sequences are more closely related''.
For instance, two sequences that share a drerived mutation
are (probably) more closely related over some span of genome surrounding the location where the mutation occurs.
\citet{fisher} pointed out that not only mutations
but also the ``junctions'' between distinct haplotypes,
if they could be somehow identified,
would be inherited as Mendelian markers.

\subsection{Motivation and statement of problem}

% PETER
% * minimize number of edges
% * gives extra info about shared haplotypes, reduces number of ancestral paths

Consider the (small portion) of a hypothetical tree sequence in Figure~\ref{fig:conceptual}A.
On the first portion of the genome (left-hand tree), the sample nodes (labeled 0, 1, and 2)
coalesce into a small subtree: 1 and 2 find a common ancestor in ancestral node 3,
which finds a common ancestor with node 0 in ancestral node 4.
On the next portion of the genome (right-hand tree), sample node 2 has a different ancestor.
This seems reasonable, and a method that infers trees separately on each portion of the genome
could not be expected to produce anything different.
However, things change once we think about what this implies about haplotype inheritance.
Figure~\ref{fig:conceptual}B shows the implied inheritance of haplotypes,
with the haplotypes carried by 4 to the left and right of the recombination breakpoint labeled $L$ and $R$.
Here, sample node 2 has inherited the chunk of haplotype labeled $L$ from ancestral node 4 via 3,
and the haplotype to the right of this from some other node (and so doesn't carry haplotype $R$).
On the other hand, sample node 1 has inherited \emph{both} haplotypes $L$ and $R$
from ancestral node 4, but the trees imply that only haplotype $L$ is inherited via ancestral node 3.
This implies -- if taken literally -- that there must have been a recombination event
at some point between node 1 and node 4 that separated the $L$ and $R$ haplotypes,
and then these two ancestral (and nonoverlapping) haplotypes coalesced together in ancestral node 4.
Although this is possible, it seems unlikely --
a more parsimonious explanation is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:conceptual}C,
in which sample node 1 inherits the entire $LR$ haplotype from ancestral node 4 through node 3
(and there is a recombination somewhere between node 3 and node 2).
This implies that ancestral node 3 inherits from node 4 on the right-hand tree as well,
which is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:conceptual}D --
and so node 3 has become unary in this tree.
Note that the more parsimonious tree sequence also includes fewer edges:
the three distinct edges $4 \to 3$, $3 \to 1$, and $4 \to 1$ in Figure~\ref{fig:conceptual}B
have been reduced to the two edges
$4 \to 3$ and $3 \to 1$ in Figure~\ref{fig:conceptual}D.

        labeled $L$ and $R$;
        \textbf{(C)} marginal trees with a unary node added,

        (that also includes fewer edges).

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Extend Edges}

% * description (HALLEY)
% * proof of something:
%     - arrives at a local minimum?
%     - guess at typical reduction? (reduces edges by 1/3?)
    We define a \textit{tree sequence}, denoted $\T$, 
    as a tuple $\left(T_1,...,T_{|\T|}\right)$ with a sequence of points
	$0 = a_0 \leq a_1 \leq \cdots < a_{|\T|} = L$ where
     each $T_k$ is a tree describing genealogical relationships between samples
     over a distinct portion of the genome $[a_{k-1}, a_k)$.
    Given any tree sequence, our goal is to
    identify areas of implied inheritance of haplotypes.
    We do so by identifying short paths (2 edges) in a tree.
    \comment{Change this if we append new Extend Edges Method to account for longer paths $p\to x \to y\to c$}
    If neighboring trees contain edges with 
    identical ancestor (parent) and descendant (child) nodes, 
    we assume that there is implied coalescence of haplotypes between nodes, 
    and we will extend the path's edges to the neighboring tree \ref{fig:extending_diagram}.
  	In more concrete terms, for a tree $T_k$ in the tree sequence $\T$ 
    suppose there exists a path which contains a node $3$,
    with parent and child nodes $4$ and $0$, respectively.
    If there is an edge between the nodes $4$ and $0$ in trees 
    $T_{k+1}$ (or $T_{k-1}$),
    then we wish to extend the edges $4\to 3$ and $3\to 0$ 
    into tree $T_{k+1}$ and then remove the edge $4 \to 0$ from $T_{k+1}$. 
    This action reduces the length of $4 \to 0$ on the genome,
    and in some cases, completely removes the edge. 
    We now perform this action on all such ancestral paths 
    over the entire tree sequence.
    With algorithm \ref{alg:edge} we only extend existing edges
    \comment{Note possible change pending algorithm change}
    over a larger interval on the genome,
    and remove unnecessary edges in the process.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=5in]{edge_extend_method.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{A visualization of the \textit{extend edges} method. Given two neighboring trees $T_1$ and $T_2$, the tree $T_1$ has a short path of edges $4 \to 3\to0$. The next tree contains a single edge $4 \to 0$. If node $3$ is not in $T_2$, then we will extend edges $ 4\to 3$ and $3\to 0$ to tree $T_2$, hence removing the edge $4\to 0$.

\par Now with an algorithm in place
 we need a metric to discern
 if trees modified with extend edges
 in fact correctly infer haplotypes in our original tree sequence.
 One such function a so called \textit{discrepancy function}, can be called on a pair of tree sequences.
 To count all the discrepancies we must begin by counting differences for each node in the tree sequence.
 
\comment{Note this is somewhat similar to the Robinson-Foulds metric in concept.}

\end{figure}

 Let $TS^1=(\{T_i^1\},N^1,E^1,L^1)$ and $TS^2=(\{T^2_j\},N^2,E^2,L^2)$ be tree sequences.
 Suppose that $x\in N^1$ and $y\in N^2$ are nodes in each tree sequence.
 We denote the \textit{set of descendant samples} of $x$ at position $i$ in the genome as $D_{TS^1}(x,i)$.
 Now for a pair of nodes $(x,y)\in TS^1\times TS^2$ 
 we can measure how much they agree along the genome.
 We do so with the following function
 $$\rho_{(TS^1,TS^2)}(x,y)=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{i=0}^{L-1}[D_{TS^1}(x,i)=D_{TS^2}(y,i)],$$
 where $L=\min\{L^1,L^2\}$ and $[\cdot]$ is the characteristic function. 
 We see $\rho$ measures the fraction of the tree sequence
 along which $x$ and $y$ have exactly the same descendant set. 
 For each node $x\in N^1$ we can use $\rho$ to find its global best matching node $y\in N^2$. 
 This node $y$ should not just be a maximum of $\rho(x,\cdot)$ but it should also have a branch length similar to $x$. 
 This means our node $y$ should minimize both $|t_x-t_y|$ and $1-\rho_{(TS^1,TS^2)}$.
 We then use this $y$ to find count the length of genome which $x$ differs from its best matching node in $TS_2$ with the function
 $$\hat{d}(x,TS^1,TS^2)=\min_y\{|t_x-t_y|(1-\rho_{(TS^1,TS^2)}(x,y))\}.$$
 Here $t_x$ and $t_y$ denote the time of occurrences (ie. branch length) for nodes $x$ and $y$. 
 The function $\hat{d}$ measures the proportion of the genome 
 over which the descendant set of $x$ differs from its best matching node $y$.
 We can now extend this from any node $x\in N^11$ to all of $TS_1$ with the \textbf{discrepancy function}
 $$d(TS_1,TS_2)=\sum_{x\in N_1}\hat{d}(x,TS_1,TS_2).$$
 This function, as we will see in the algorithm below,
 is $|N^1||\{T^1\}|$ as for each tree in $TS_1$ and each node $x\in N^1$ we only need to look at $O(1)$ nodes rather than all nodes in $N^2$.

Simple experiment:
(1) simulate, simplify, and extend;
(2) let $x$ be total matching span of simplified tree (here equal to the total span); $y$ total matching span of extended tree in truth and $z$ total not-matching span;
then $z$ is "total wrongly added stuff" and $y-x$ is "total rightly added stuff".

With tsinfer: (1) simulate and tsinfer; (2) do the above either with or without simplifying the tsinfer'ed trees.
(but also take into account that there's wrong stuff in tsinfer'ed tree: look at whether it reduces discrepancy!)
