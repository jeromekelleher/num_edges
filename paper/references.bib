  abstract = {A metric on general phylogenetic trees is presented. This extends the work of most previous authors, who constructed metrics for binary trees. The metric presented in this paper makes possible the comparison of the many nonbinary phylogenetic trees appearing in the literature. This provides an objective procedure for comparing the different methods for constructing phylogenetic trees. The metric is based on elementary operations which transform one tree into another. Various results obtained in applying these operations are given. They enable the distance between any pair of trees to be calculated efficiently. This generalizes previous work by Bourque to the case where interior vertices can be labeled, and labels may contain more than one element or may be empty.}

  abstract = {As a genetic mutation is passed down across generations, it distinguishes those genomes that have inherited it from those that have not, providing a glimpse of the genealogical tree relating the genomes to each other at that site. Statistical summaries of genetic variation therefore also describe the underlying genealogies. We use this correspondence to define a general framework that efficiently computes single-site population genetic statistics using the succinct tree sequence encoding of genealogies and genome sequence. The general approach accumulates “sample weights” within each marginal tree, which are then combined using a “summary function”; different statistics result from different choices of weight and function. Results can be reported in two dual ways: by site, which corresponds to statistics calculated from genome sequence; and by branch, which gives the expected value of the site statistic under the infinite-sites model of mutation. We use the framework to implement many currently-defined statistics of genome sequence (making the statistics’ relationship to the underlying genealogical trees concrete and explicit) and suggest several new statistics. We evaluate computational performance using simulated data, and show that calculating statistics from tree sequences using this general framework is several orders of magnitude more efficient than optimized matrix-based methods in terms of both run time and memory requirements. We also explore how well the duality between site and branch statistics holds in practice on trees inferred from the 1000 Genomes Project dataset, and discuss ways in which deviations may encode interesting biological signals.},
